We will denote with $E_G(V_1, V_2)$ the cut generated by a bipartition $(V_1, V_2)$ of $V(G)$.\\

$(a)$\\o
Let $\phi \in [0, c(uv) - \alpha(uv)]$.\\
Let the new cost function be $c' : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $c'(xy)$ = 
$\begin{cases}
  c(xy), \text{ if } xy \in E \setminus \{uv\}\\
  c(xy) - \phi, \text{ if } xy = uv\\
\end{cases}$\\
$\phi \leq c(uv) - \alpha(uv) \Rightarrow c'(uv) \geq c(uv) - (c(uv) - \alpha(uv)) \Rightarrow c'(uv) \geq \alpha(uv)$.\\
Proof by contradiction:\\
Assume there exists a spanning tree $T' \subseteq G$ such that $c'(T') < c'(T)$.\\
If $uv \notin E(T')$, then we have $c'(T') = c(T') \Rightarrow c(T') < c(T)$\\
This contradicts $T$ being a minimum cost spanning tree of $G$ with respect to $c$, therefore we know that:\\
$\forall$ $T''$ such that $T''$ is an MST in $G$ with respect to $c'$, we have $uv \in E(T'')$ $(i)$.\\
Since $T'$ is a tree, we know $uv$ is a bridge in $T'$, and $T' - uv$ has exactly two connected components.\\
Let $V_1$ and $V_2$ be the two connected components of $T' - uv$. It is obvious that $(V_1, V_2)$ is a partition of $V(T') = V(G)$.\\
Without loss of generality, assume that $u \in V_1$ and $v \in V_2$.\\
Consider $P_T(u, v)$, the unique path in $T$ from $u$ to $v$.\\
We know that $P_T(u, v)$ must contain an edge $xy \in E_G(V_1, V_2)$, since $u$ and $v$ are in different components of $T' - uv$.\\
We also know that $\alpha(uv) \leq c'(uv)$, which means that all edges on $P_T(u, v)$ have cost less than or equal to $c'(uv)$.\\
So we know that there exists an edge $xy \in E_G(V_1, V_2)$ such that $c'(xy) \leq c'(uv)$.\\
Then we can take $T'' = (V(T'), E(T') \setminus \{uv\} \cup \{xy\})$, which is a spanning tree of $G$.\\
But then we have that: $c'(T'') = c'(T') - c'(uv) + c'(xy) \leq c'(T') \Rightarrow T''$ is an MST of $G$ with respect to $c'$, but, since $uv \notin E(T'')$, this contradicts $(i)$. \\
We have reached a contradiction, therefore our assumption was false, meaning there cannot exist a spanning tree of $G$ that has a cost strictly less than $T$ with respect to $c'$ $\Rightarrow$ $T$ is an MST of $G$ with respect to $c'$.\\

$(b)$\\
Let $\phi \in [0, \beta(uv) - c(uv)]$.\\
Let the new cost function be $c' : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $c'(xy)$ = 
$\begin{cases}
  c(xy), \text{ if } xy \in E \setminus \{uv\}\\
  c(xy) + \phi, \text{ if } xy = uv\\
\end{cases}$\\
$\phi \leq \beta(uv) - c(uv) \Rightarrow c'(uv) \leq c(uv) + (\beta(uv) - c(uv)) \Rightarrow c'(uv) \leq \beta(uv)$.\\
Proof by contradiction:\\
Assume there exists a spanning tree $T' \subseteq G$ such that $c'(T') < c'(T)$.\\
Notice that $c'(T) = c(T) + \phi$.\\
If $uv \in E(T')$, then we have $c'(T') = c(T') + \phi, c'(T') < c'(T) \Rightarrow c(T') + \phi < c(T) + \phi \Rightarrow c(T') < c(T)$.\\
This contradicts $T$ being an MST of $G$ with respect to $c$, therefore we know that:\\
$\forall$ $T''$ such that $T''$ is an MST in $G$ with respect to $c'$, we have $uv \notin E(T'')$ $(ii)$.\\
Since $T$ is a tree, we know $uv$ is a bridge in $T$, and $T - uv$ has exactly two connected components.\\
Let $V_1$ and $V_2$ be the two connected components of $T - uv$. It is obvious that $(V_1, V_2)$ is a partition of $V(T) = V(G)$.\\
Without loss of generality, assume that $u \in V_1$ and $v \in V_2$.\\
Consider $P_{T'}(u, v)$, the unique path in $T'$ from $u$ to $v$.\\
We know that $P_{T'}(u, v)$ must contain an edge $xy \in E_G(V_1, V_2)$, since $u$ and $v$ are in different components of $T - uv$.\\
We also know that $c'(uv) \leq \beta(uv)$, which means that all edges on $P_{T'}(u, v)$ have cost greater than or equal to $c'(uv)$.\\
So we know that there exists an edge $xy \in E_G(V_1, V_2)$ such that $c'(xy) \geq c'(uv)$, and $xy \in E(T')$.\\
Then we can take $T'' = (V(T'), E(T') \setminus \{xy\} \cup \{uv\})$, which is a spanning tree of $G$.\\
But then we have that: $c'(T'') = c'(T') - c'(xy) + c'(uv) \leq c'(T') \Rightarrow T''$ is an MST of $G$ with respect to $c'$, but, since $uv \in E(T'')$, this contradicts $(ii)$. \\
We have reached a contradiction, therefore our assumption was false, meaning there cannot exist a spanning tree of $G$ that has a cost strictly less than $T$ with respect to $c'$ $\Rightarrow$ $T$ is an MST of $G$ with respect to $c'$.\\
